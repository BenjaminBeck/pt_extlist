What does it do?
================

This extension is intended to generate all sorts of lists. The data sources for the list can be a database or an extbase repository or anything you write a data-backend for (SOAP, CSV, XML, ...).

There are different steps you have to do if you want to set up a list. For a detailed example see section "Instruction".

Here are some screenshots to give you an impression of how it looks like.
